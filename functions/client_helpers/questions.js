If they lie down too soon, the food will create pressure in the gastrointestinal tract and gastric juices will flow into the esophagus.  This fluid damages the esophagus so we need to keep them upright to avoid that.  People with GERD should avoid spicy and fatty foods as these can increase reflux.  The largest meal of the day needs to be breakfast as dinner time is close to going to sleep which can increase the risk of lying down too soon.  Our digestive system needs time to break down and process foods so eating earlier helps prevent reflux as well."

Perseveration involves repeating either movements or words over and over again.  This is something we see in dementia clients however it does not cause confusion.  Intervention is something medical staff do to help the client with completing their care.  An example of an intervention is offering a heating pad when the client states they have pain or toileting the client every two hours to lessen incontinent episodes."
